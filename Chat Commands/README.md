# Chat Commands System

This is just [longbow's chatcom](https://github.com/ussrlongbow/chatcom) but no longer packaged as an a3ms addon. 

Also features a minor modification: string parameters. Parameters that start with a quote mark (") begin a string, which then ends with the first parameter that ends with a quote mark. This allows you to pass parameters that include spaces. Note: the implementation of this is a bit shaky at the moment, as it was a quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept.
