Functions:

/ Set up Spectrum Device params automatically (min/max values)
	/ Vary parameters based on selected antenna?
/ Maintain list of signals
/ Update local #EM_Values accordingly:-
	/ Add/remove signals that come in to/out of range. 
	/ Attenuate signal strength by distance and direction (params to toggle?)
	/ Signal strength exponent option, for quadratic (etc.) falloff?
/ Allow mission creator to add signals via function
/ Allow mission creator to remove signals via function
- Allow mission creator to modify and/or see parameters for signals?
- Option for "transmit" function of Spectrum to output signal to other Spectrum devices?
	- Must also include action for enabling/disabling transmission
	- Will require MP sync
- Option for jamming antenna to interfere with signal detection?
- Integration with TFAR and/or ACRE, allowing Spectrum to track enemy radios?
/ Upgrade to 3D distance/direction?

- Direction "fuzzing"
	- Deadzone that gets more forgiving the closer to the signal you are
	- Possibly relative to min. range?
	- wait hang on this is just what the exponent can do, kind of

/ Option to select between 2D/3D modes

- Automatically adjust selection width to suit frequency range?
